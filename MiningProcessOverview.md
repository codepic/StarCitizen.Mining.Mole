# 3. Mining Process Overview

## 3.1 Multicrew MOLE Mining
- Step-by-step multicrew mining process using the MOLE.
- Roles, communication, and workflow.

## Solo MOLE Mining
- How to mine efficiently with a single player in the MOLE.
- Tips for managing all turrets: prioritize the front turret for main breaks, then switch to side turrets for sub-breaks and extraction.
- Use ship positioning to minimize the need to move between turrets.
- Recommended module and head setup for solo play.
- Managing power, overcharge, and extraction as a solo operator.

## 3.2 Multi-Ship Mining with Caterpillar Ore Pod Swapping
- How to use a Caterpillar with Argo Ore Pods for on-field swapping and hauling to refinery.
- Logistics, timing, and crew roles.
- How to load the Caterpillar:
  - Dock the MOLE with the Caterpillar in the field.
  - Use the tractor beam or ship controls to transfer full Argo Ore Pods from the MOLE to the Caterpillar's cargo grid.
  - Secure the pods in the Caterpillar for transport.
  - Swap in empty pods to the MOLE for continued mining.

## 3.3 Other Mining Styles
- Brief overviews of alternative mining setups (e.g., multi-MOLE, prospector support, etc.)
- Pros and cons of each style.
