# The Impact of Different Ore Tiers' Mass-to-SCU Ratio on Mining Profitability in Star Citizen

## Abstract

This study analyzes the impact of [B-Tier ore](https://regolith.rocks/survey/ores?ot=B) Mass to SCU ratio on mining profitability in Star Citizen. Using in-game data, community discussions, and scenario analysis, we compare the effects of ore composition and mining strategies on value per trip, efficiency, and overall profit. Our findings show that the Mass to SCU ratio is a critical factor for volume miners, especially with the advent of on-field ore bag swapping, while value-focused miners should prioritize other rock modifiers.

## Background and Hypothesis

**Background:**  
With the release of Star Citizen 3.19, the mass-to-SCU (Standard Cargo Unit) conversion for mined ores changed significantly. Previously, 1 SCU equaled 50 mass for all materials, making calculations straightforward. In 3.19, each material now has its own density, so the amount of mass required to fill 1 SCU varies by ore type. This means two rocks of the same mass and percentage can yield very different SCU depending on the material, making it harder to estimate cargo value and plan mining operations.

**Hypothesis (from online discussions):**  
The main hypothesis is that the profitability of mining is now heavily influenced by the mass-to-SCU ratio of each ore. Ores with a lower mass-to-SCU ratio (less mass required to fill 1 SCU) are more profitable, as they allow miners to fill their cargo holds with less mass and maximize value per SCU. Ores with a high mass-to-SCU ratio (like gold) are less efficient, requiring more mass to fill the same cargo space and thus reducing overall profitability. This has led to a shift in mining priorities, with players favoring ores like beryl, bexalite, and quantanium, and avoiding high-mass, low-value ores.

**Additional Hypothesis:**  
It has also been hypothesized that miners should focus on [B-Tier ores](https://regolith.rocks/survey/ores?ot=B) when choosing a mining location, using the Mass to SCU ratio of these ores as a key factor in selecting the most profitable mining sites. This approach suggests that evaluating the density and efficiency of [B-Tier ores](https://regolith.rocks/survey/ores?ot=B) at a location can help maximize rock value and overall mining profitability.

## Purpose and Scope of This Analysis
Since we're talking about Mass to SCU, which affects both mass and volume, it's important to examine the real-world effect of the presence of [B-Tier ore](https://regolith.rocks/survey/ores?ot=B) in a rock. Profitability is not only determined by the value of a rock, but also by how many round trips you need to make to the refinery. Rocks with high-mass, low-value [B-Tier ores](https://regolith.rocks/survey/ores?ot=B) can fill your cargo hold faster, but may require more trips and reduce overall efficiency, while low-mass, high-value ores maximize profit per trip and minimize downtime.

## Methodology

- Data was collected from community calculators (e.g., Regolith's Cluster Calculator), and online discussions (Reddit, YouTube).
- Calculations for value per Mole, % best, and moles filled are based on standard cargo unit (SCU) conversions and ore mass-to-SCU ratios as observed in Star Citizen 4.1.1.
- The comparison tables were constructed by holding total rock mass and ore percentages constant, varying only the [B-Tier ore](https://regolith.rocks/survey/ores?ot=B) type to isolate its effect on profitability and efficiency.
- The Mole mining ship was used as the reference for all calculations involving cargo capacity and value per trip, as it is a common choice for group mining and provides a consistent baseline for comparison.
- Assumptions include consistent ore percentages and mass across compared rocks, and that all mining ships and refining processes operate under standard game mechanics.

## Limitations

- The analysis is based on current game mechanics and may change with future updates.
- Ore values and mass-to-SCU ratios are subject to change by developers.
- Some data is based on community-sourced calculators and may not reflect all in-game scenarios.
- Field studies and in-game testing need to be conducted to verify these results and ensure their applicability in real mining operations.
