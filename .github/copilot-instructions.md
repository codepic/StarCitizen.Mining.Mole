# Markdown

## headings
- Do not make links to headings.

## Mermaid Diagrams
- Do not make markdown links to Mermaid diagrams.

## Tables
- Always leave an empty line before a table to ensure proper rendering with Github Pages.

## Table of Contents in README.md
- Always ensure that the links in the Table of Contents are correct and point to the right sections in the documents.
- Top-level headings should link directly to the document without a link to a specific heading.
- Before updating the Table of Contents, ensure that the linked document has consistent heading levels and numberings.
