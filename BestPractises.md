# Best Practises

## Power Management

### Shutting Down Mining Turrets

Before leaving a mining turret, always reduce the fracture mode power to its minimum setting and fully shut down the turret. This prevents accidental overcharging or detonation of rocks when the turret is next used.

### Preventing Quantum Travel Issues

Leaving mining turrets powered on can interfere with Quantum Travel, as active turrets may block the initiation of quantum jumps. This forces the pilot to manually turn off each turret, causing unnecessary delays. Properly shutting down turrets ensures smooth and uninterrupted transitions between mining and travel.
