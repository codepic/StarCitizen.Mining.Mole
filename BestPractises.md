# 6. Best Practises

## 6.1 Power Management

- **Leave Shields On While Mining:**  
  The pilot should always keep the shipâ€™s shields active during mining operations. Shields provide critical protection against potential catastrophic explosions from unstable rocks, helping to prevent hull damage or loss of the ship.

- **Turret Operator Power Configuration:**  
  Even with shields on, turret operators can still configure and manage power settings directly from their mining turrets. This allows each operator to fine-tune their mining laserâ€™s output for optimal performance without needing to adjust ship-wide power settings.

- **Shutting Down Mining Turrets:**  
  Before leaving a mining turret, always reduce the fracture mode power to its minimum setting and fully shut down the turret. This prevents accidental overcharging or detonation of rocks when the turret is next used.

- **Preventing Quantum Travel Issues:**  
  Leaving mining turrets powered on can interfere with Quantum Travel, as active turrets may block the initiation of quantum jumps. This forces the pilot to manually turn off each turret, causing unnecessary delays. Properly shutting down turrets ensures smooth and uninterrupted transitions between mining and travel.

- **Additional Tips:**  
  - Monitor shield strength during mining, especially after a rock explosion.
  - Communicate with turret operators to coordinate power usage and avoid overloading the shipâ€™s power plant.
