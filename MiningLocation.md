# 2. Mining Location Selection in Star Citizen

**Process for Choosing a Mining Location:**

1. **Identify your miner type, skill level, group setup, and goals.**
2. **Map your needs to relevant ore properties.**
3. **Shortlist the ores that best fit your criteria.**
4. **Use Regolith's Ore Survey to find locations rich in your target ores.**

This step-by-step approach ensures your mining runs are efficient, profitable, and tailored to your playstyle.

## 2.1 Factors Influencing Mining Location Choice

Before selecting a mining location, take a moment to identify what kind of miner you are and what you want from your mining experience. Clarifying your goals and needs will help ensure a smoother, more profitable session.

### 2.1.1 Miner Type

There are three main types of miners, each with distinct goals and strategies:

**Value Miners** focus exclusively on the highest-value ores (S- and A-Tier), often discarding or ignoring B- and C-Tier ores. Their goal is to maximize profit per trip by only extracting the most lucrative materials, even if it means leaving rocks partially unmined or making fewer, more selective hauls. This approach is best for those who want the highest return for their time and are willing to be patient and discerning in their rock selection.

**Volume Miners** collect and refine everything, regardless of ore tier. They fill their cargo holds as quickly as possible, maximizing throughput and minimizing downtime. This strategy is well-suited for group mining, multi-ship operations, or when using on-field ore bag swapping with haulers. Volume miners benefit most from efficient logistics and are less concerned with ore quality, focusing instead on total yield and operational efficiency.

**A-Tier Focus Miners** target rocks rich in A-Tier ores, sometimes discarding C-Tier ores but often refining B-Tier ores if present. They strike a balance between the selectivity of value miners and the throughput of volume miners, aiming for a steady profit while maintaining flexibility. This approach is ideal for those who want consistent returns without the strict selectivity of value mining or the indiscriminate approach of volume mining.

Understanding your miner type will help you choose the most suitable locations, equipment, and strategies for your playstyle and goals.

### 2.1.2 Skill Level

Your mining skill level will influence which locations and rocks are suitable for you. Beginners may want to focus on rocks and locations with forgiving properties, while advanced miners can take on more challenging breaks for higher rewards.

Key ore properties to consider based on your skill level include:

- **Instability:** Lower instability makes it easier to keep the energy bar steady during fracturing, reducing the risk of overcharging or failed breaks. Beginners should seek rocks with low instability.
- **Explosion Strength:** Ores with lower explosion strength are safer, minimizing the risk of catastrophic explosions that can damage or destroy your ship. This is especially important for new miners.
- **Resistance:** Lower resistance means rocks require less power to break, making them easier to handle with standard equipment and less coordination.
- **Green Zone Thinness:** A wider green zone gives you more room for error when maintaining the correct energy input. Narrow green zones demand more precision and are better suited for experienced miners.
- **Clustering:** High clustering values mean valuable minerals are more likely to be concentrated together, making it easier to extract the best ores with fewer breaks and less waste.

As you gain experience, you can gradually take on rocks with higher instability, resistance, or narrower green zones to maximize your yield and profit.

### 2.1.3 Personal Preference

Your personal preference plays a significant role in mining location selection. Some miners enjoy a relaxed, low-risk experience—choosing locations with easy-to-break rocks, minimal instability, and low explosion risk, even if it means lower overall profit. Others thrive on challenge, seeking out locations with high-resistance or high-instability rocks that require precise technique and coordination, aiming for the satisfaction of conquering the toughest breaks and maximizing yield.

You might also prefer scenic or quiet locations for immersion, or busy areas for social interaction and teamwork. Ultimately, your enjoyment and satisfaction should guide your choices—there is no single "best" location, only the one that best fits your playstyle and goals.

### 2.1.4 Group Size and Roles

The size and structure of your mining group can significantly affect your choice of location and mining strategy. Solo miners often prioritize locations with accessible rocks, manageable resistance, and minimal threats, as they must handle all aspects of mining, hauling, and safety themselves. Multi-crew or multi-ship groups can tackle more challenging sites, break larger or tougher rocks, and operate more efficiently by dividing roles—such as dedicated turret operators, scouts, and haulers.

Larger groups benefit from coordination and specialization, allowing for advanced tactics like on-field ore pod swapping, rapid extraction, and continuous mining. The presence of support ships or haulers can also open up remote or high-yield locations that would be impractical for solo miners. When choosing a location, consider your group's size, available ships, and the roles each member will play to maximize efficiency, safety, and profit.

## 2.2 Understanding Ore Properties and Tables

The following sections provide detailed tables and explanations of ore properties relevant to mining in Star Citizen. These tables summarize key attributes—such as clustering, explosion strength, instability, resistance, green zone thinness, and mass to SCU—for each ore tier. Understanding these properties will help you evaluate which rocks and locations best match your miner type, skill level, preferences, and group setup. Use these tables as a reference to inform your mining decisions and optimize your strategy for efficiency, safety, and profit.

### 2.2.1 Explanation of Table Columns

#### 2.2.1.1 Clustering 🔗
Indicates how well each type of mineral tends to stick together within a rock. Higher clustering means valuable minerals are more likely to be concentrated in one break, making it easier to extract high-value ore with fewer breaks and less waste. In practice, high clustering improves efficiency and profit, especially for value miners.

> **Most relevant for:** Value Miners and A-Tier Focus Miners, who maximize yield from selective mining. Beginners and solo miners also appreciate high clustering for simplicity, while large groups can exploit it for efficient teamwork.

#### 2.2.1.2 Explosion Strength 💥
Represents the intensity of potentially explosive reactions during mining. Lower explosion strength means a reduced risk of catastrophic explosions, making mining safer and less stressful. High explosion strength rocks require more caution and skill, as explosions can damage or destroy your ship.

> **Matters most to:** Beginners, solo miners, and those who prefer relaxed mining, as safety is a priority. Advanced players and groups may take on higher explosion strength rocks for challenge or greater reward, but must coordinate carefully.

#### 2.2.1.3 Instability ⚡
Measures how erratic the energy input/output curve is during mining. High instability causes the energy bar to fluctuate, making it harder to keep the rock in the optimal green zone. Lower instability is easier for beginners and reduces the risk of failed breaks or overcharging.

> **Especially important for:** New miners, solo players, and those seeking a stress-free experience. High instability may appeal to skilled miners or groups looking for a challenge and higher-value rocks.

#### 2.2.1.4 Resistance 🛡️
Indicates how much energy the rock absorbs before it starts to fracture. Higher resistance means you’ll need more powerful lasers or longer charge times. Lower resistance rocks are easier to break and require less coordination, making them suitable for solo or less experienced miners.

> **Best suited for:** Beginners, solo miners, and those with basic equipment, who should seek low-resistance rocks. Groups with multiple turrets or advanced gear can handle higher resistance and may target such rocks for greater yield.

#### 2.2.1.5 Green Zone Thinness 🟩
Describes how narrow the “sweet spot” is for maintaining energy during fracturing. A thinner green zone demands more precision and control to avoid overcharging or undercharging. Wider green zones are more forgiving and better for beginners or relaxed mining sessions.

> **Favored by:** New miners, solo players, and those who prefer a relaxed pace, who benefit from wide green zones. Narrow green zones are a challenge for experienced miners or coordinated groups seeking to maximize efficiency and profit.

#### 2.2.1.6 Mass to SCU ⚖️
The mass of the resource required to fill one Standard Cargo Unit (SCU). Lower values are more profitable, as you can fill your cargo hold with less mass and maximize value per trip. This property is especially important for volume miners and when planning efficient hauling and refining operations. Lower mass rocks are also easier to break, making them better suited for beginners and solo miners who may have less powerful equipment or prefer a simpler mining experience.

> **Critical for:** Volume Miners and large groups with haulers, as it maximizes cargo efficiency. Value Miners may care less if they are highly selective. Beginners benefit from low mass-to-SCU rocks because they are easier to break and manage, supporting a smoother learning curve and safer solo mining.
