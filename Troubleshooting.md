# 9. Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

### Cargo Shows 0.00/0.00 SCU
- **Cause:** The MOLEâ€™s ore pods may not initialize correctly after spawning or reclaiming the ship, causing them to appear missing or unrecognized by the cargo system.
- **Solution 1:** Just start mining and see if the cargo initializes when you start scooping the ore.
- **Solution 2:** Manually detach and reattach an ore pod using a tractor beam to force initialization.
- **Walkthrough:**
    1. From the pilot seat, unlock the shipâ€™s ports by pressing Right-Alt + K.
    2. Power down shields to avoid interference or accidental damage.
    3. Exit the ship and equip your tractor beam tool.
    4. Approach one of the ore pods and detach it using the tractor beam.
    5. Reattach the pod carefullyâ€”it should snap into place.
    6. Return to the cockpit and confirm that the cargo hold now reflects the correct SCU.
    7. If all looks good, lock the ports again with Right-Alt + K.

### Cannot Cycle Mining Laser Intensity Up or Down
- **Cause:** Unknown
- **Solution:** Land the vehicle, bedlog, and log back into the same server.

### Laser Not Firing
- **Cause:** Insufficient power or incorrect module configuration.
- **Solution:** Check power settings and ensure modules are properly installed.
