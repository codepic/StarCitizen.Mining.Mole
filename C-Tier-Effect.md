# 7. The Impact of C-Tier Ore Mass-to-SCU Ratio on Mining Profitability in Star Citizen

## 7.1 Abstract

This study analyzes the impact of [C-Tier ore](https://regolith.rocks/survey/ores?ot=C) Mass to SCU ratio on mining profitability in Star Citizen. Using in-game data, community discussions, and scenario analysis, we compare the effects of ore composition and mining strategies on value per trip, efficiency, and overall profit. Our findings show that the Mass to SCU ratio is a critical factor for volume miners, especially with the advent of on-field ore bag swapping, while value-focused miners should prioritize other rock modifiers.

## 7.2 Background and Hypothesis

**Background:**  
With the release of Star Citizen 3.19, the mass-to-SCU (Standard Cargo Unit) conversion for mined ores changed significantly. Previously, 1 SCU equaled 50 mass for all materials, making calculations straightforward. In 3.19, each material now has its own density, so the amount of mass required to fill 1 SCU varies by ore type. This means two rocks of the same mass and percentage can yield very different SCU depending on the material, making it harder to estimate cargo value and plan mining operations.

**Hypothesis (from online discussions):**  
The main hypothesis is that the profitability of mining is now heavily influenced by the mass-to-SCU ratio of each ore. Ores with a lower mass-to-SCU ratio (less mass required to fill 1 SCU) are more profitable, as they allow miners to fill their cargo holds with less mass and maximize value per SCU. Ores with a high mass-to-SCU ratio (like gold) are less efficient, requiring more mass to fill the same cargo space and thus reducing overall profitability. This has led to a shift in mining priorities, with players favoring ores like beryl, bexalite, and quantanium, and avoiding high-mass, low-value ores.

**Additional Hypothesis:**  
It has also been hypothesized that miners should focus on [C-Tier ores](https://regolith.rocks/survey/ores?ot=C) when choosing a mining location, using the Mass to SCU ratio of these ores as a key factor in selecting the most profitable mining sites. This approach suggests that evaluating the density and efficiency of [C-Tier ores](https://regolith.rocks/survey/ores?ot=C) at a location can help maximize rock value and overall mining profitability.

## 7.3 Purpose and Scope of This Analysis
Since we're talking about Mass to SCU, which affects both mass and volume, it's important to examine the real-world effect of the presence of [C-Tier ore](https://regolith.rocks/survey/ores?ot=C) in a rock. Profitability is not only determined by the value of a rock, but also by how many round trips you need to make to the refinery. Rocks with high-mass, low-value [C-Tier ores](https://regolith.rocks/survey/ores?ot=C) can fill your cargo hold faster, but may require more trips and reduce overall efficiency, while low-mass, high-value ores maximize profit per trip and minimize downtime.

---

## 7.4 Methodology

- Data was collected from community calculators (e.g., Regolith's Cluster Calculator), and online discussions (Reddit, YouTube).
- Calculations for value per Mole, % best, and moles filled are based on standard cargo unit (SCU) conversions and ore mass-to-SCU ratios as observed in Star Citizen 4.1.1.
- The comparison tables were constructed by holding total rock mass and ore percentages constant, varying only the [C-Tier ore](https://regolith.rocks/survey/ores?ot=C) type to isolate its effect on profitability and efficiency.
- The Mole mining ship was used as the reference for all calculations involving cargo capacity and value per trip, as it is a common choice for group mining and provides a consistent baseline for comparison.
- Assumptions include consistent ore percentages and mass across compared rocks, and that all mining ships and refining processes operate under standard game mechanics.

---

## 7.5 Limitations

- The analysis is based on current game mechanics and may change with future updates.
- Ore values and mass-to-SCU ratios are subject to change by developers.
- Some data is based on community-sourced calculators and may not reflect all in-game scenarios.
- Field studies and in-game testing need to be conducted to verify these results and ensure their applicability in real mining operations.

## 7.6 About C-Tier Ore Modifiers

1. **Modifiers Affect Profitability**: [C-tier ores](https://regolith.rocks/survey/ores?ot=C) have properties that influence the behavior of rocks during mining. Since these ores will constitute the majority of the mass, their modifiers‚Äîsuch as Mass to SCU ratio, resistance, and instability‚Äîplay a crucial role in determining the efficiency and profitability of mining operations.

2. **Cherry-Picking Favorable Modifiers**: By focusing on [C-tier ores](https://regolith.rocks/survey/ores?ot=C) with favorable modifiers, miners can ensure that the rocks they target are easier to break, safer to handle, and more efficient to extract. This strategic selection minimizes risks and maximizes yields.

3. **Abundance**: [C-tier ores](https://regolith.rocks/survey/ores?ot=C) are the most abundant, meaning most rocks will contain them. This abundance makes them a reliable indicator for identifying viable mining locations.

Even though these ores may ultimately be discarded, their impact on the overall mining process makes them a factor in choosing the right location.

### 7.6.1 Explanation of Table Columns

- **Material ü™®**: The type of ore or resource being mined.
- **Clustering üîó**: Indicates how well each type of mineral tends to stick together. Higher values mean cleaner splits, where the valuable minerals remain in their own breaks and the less valuable ones in theirs. **Higher values are more profitable**.
- **Explosion Strength üí•**: Represents the intensity of potentially explosive reactions during mining. **Lower values are safer**.
- **Instability ‚ö°**: Instability measures how erratic the energy input/output curve is during mining. High instability means the energy bar will fluctuate wildly, making it harder to keep the rock in the optimal green zone. **Lower values are easier**.
- **Resistance üõ°Ô∏è**: Resistance is how much energy the rock absorbs before it starts to fracture. Higher resistance means you‚Äôll need more powerful lasers or longer charge times to break it apart. **Lower values are easier**.
- **Green Zone Thinness üü©**: This affects how narrow the ‚Äúsweet spot‚Äù is for maintaining energy during fracturing. A thinner green zone demands more precision and control to avoid overcharging or undercharging. **Lower values are easier**.
- **Mass to SCU ‚öñÔ∏è**: The mass of the resource required to fill one Standard Cargo Unit (SCU). **Lower values are more profitable**.

## 7.7 How Does C-Tier Ore Mass to SCU Affect Profitability?

The mass-to-SCU ratio determines how much ore is needed to fill a cargo unit. Lower ratios mean you fill your hold with less mass, increasing profit per SCU. This section explores how [C-Tier ore](https://regolith.rocks/survey/ores?ot=C)‚Äôs mass-to-SCU impacts mining returns.
