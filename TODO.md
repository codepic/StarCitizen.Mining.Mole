## Visual Enhancements

- [ ] **Add a labeled diagram of the MOLE turret layout** to [BaseSetup.md#11-turret-loadout-overview](BaseSetup.md#11-turret-loadout-overview). _Why:_ Helps newcomers quickly understand turret positions and their roles. _Outcome:_ Faster onboarding and clearer crew coordination.
- [ ] **Insert a flowchart or infographic of the multi-turret mining sequence** in [BaseSetup.md#15-coordinated-multi-turret-operation](BaseSetup.md#15-coordinated-multi-turret-operation). _Why:_ Visualizes teamwork steps for both new and experienced players. _Outcome:_ Reduces mistakes and improves group efficiency.
- [ ] **Add a visual summary of mining gadget effects** to [BaseSetup.md#12-gadgets](BaseSetup.md#12-gadgets). _Why:_ Makes it easier to compare gadgets at a glance. _Outcome:_ Quicker decision-making for all players.
- [ ] **Create a radar detection formula diagram** for [RadarMechanics.md#33-signal-detection-mechanics-breaking-down-the-radar-formula](RadarMechanics.md#33-signal-detection-mechanics-breaking-down-the-radar-formula). _Why:_ Clarifies how each parameter affects detection. _Outcome:_ Demystifies the math for non-technical readers and supports advanced optimization.
- [ ] **Add a visual comparing scanned volumes/areas by ship** to [RadarMechanics.md#34-radar-parameters-explained](RadarMechanics.md#34-radar-parameters-explained) and [RadarMechanics.md#35-how-much-can-you-scan-effective-scanning-volume](RadarMechanics.md#35-how-much-can-you-scan-effective-scanning-volume). _Why:_ Shows the impact of ship choice on mining efficiency. _Outcome:_ Informs ship selection and scanning strategy.
- [ ] **Include a step-by-step infographic for resource scanning** in [ResourceScanning.md#42-identifying-deposit-types-from-kilometers-away](ResourceScanning.md#42-identifying-deposit-types-from-kilometers-away-). _Why:_ Helps new players master scanning quickly. _Outcome:_ Reduces learning curve and increases success rate.
- [ ] **Add a visual guide to ore cutoff calculation** in [OreCutoff.md#53-practical-cutoff-guidelines](OreCutoff.md#53-practical-cutoff-guidelines). _Why:_ Makes the math and logic behind cutoff decisions more accessible. _Outcome:_ Empowers all players to make better mining choices.
